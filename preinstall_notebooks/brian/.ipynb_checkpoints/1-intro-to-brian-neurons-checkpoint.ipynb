Firstly, we've added the keyword ``refractory=5*ms`` to the ``NeuronGroup`` declaration. On its own, this only means that the neuron cannot spike in this period (see below), but doesn't change how ``v`` behaves. In order to make ``v`` stay constant during the refractory period, we have to add ``(unless refractory)`` to the end of the definition of ``v`` in the differential equations.

Since the refractory period is now 15 ms this means that the neuron won't be able to spike again until time 8 + 15 = 23 ms. Immediately after the first spike, the value of ``v`` now instantly starts to rise because we didn't specify ``(unless refractory)`` in the definition of ``dv/dt``. However, once it reaches the value 0.8 (the dashed green line) at time roughly 8 ms it doesn't fire a spike even though the threshold is ``v>0.8``. This is because the neuron is still refractory until time 23 ms, at which point it fires a spike.\n",
